You can create yaml files where you can configure predefined configuration. This can be helpful for different mqtt environments.
This files must be stored in the environment directory (by default ~/.mqtt-shell/).

For example:
```yaml
broker: tls://127.0.0.1:8883
ca: /tmp/my.ca
subscribe-qos: 1
publish-qos: 2
username: user
password:  secret
client-id: my-mqtt-shell
clean-session: true
commands: 
  - sub #
non-interactive: false
history-file: /home/user/.mqtt-shell/history
prompt: "\033[36mmsh>\033[0m "
macros:
  my-macro:
    description: Awesome description of my macro
    arguments:
      - message
    commands:
      - pub test $1
```
